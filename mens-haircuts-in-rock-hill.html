Our barbers are experienced with all hair types and can handle everything from a simple business cut to more detailed styles like pompadours, undercuts, and textured crops. We also offer hot towel treatments and eyebrow trimming to complete your grooming experience."

We do accept walk-ins, but we recommend calling ahead or booking online since we can get busy, especially on weekends and after work hours. Wait times for walk-ins are typically 15-30 minutes during weekdays, but can be longer on Saturdays. Appointments guarantee your preferred time slot."

Our team has a combined 40+ years of experience, with each barber having at least 5 years in the industry. We regularly attend training workshops to stay current with the latest techniques and trends. You can feel confident that you're getting a professional cut from skilled, certified barbers."

Every cut includes a consultation to discuss what you want, the haircut itself, styling, and a neck cleanup with a straight razor. We also include a hot towel finish and light scalp massage. If you're getting a beard trim as well, plan for about an hour total."

We'll either adjust the cut to better match what you wanted or have another barber take a look if needed. We've been serving the Rock Hill community for years and our reputation depends on making sure every customer leaves happy. Most issues can be resolved with minor adjustments during your visit, so don't hesitate to speak up if something doesn't look right."

                    <div class="testimonial-text">Been going to Carolina Barber Co for about 8 months now and they're solid. My usual guy Jake knows exactly what I want - just a clean fade on the sides, not too short on top. Takes maybe 25-30 minutes and I'm out the door looking fresh. Only complaint is sometimes the wait can be long if you don't book ahead, but that's probably a good sign that they're busy for a reason. Definitely recommend if you want a no-nonsense cut.</div>

                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">Took my 16-year-old son here last week because his regular place was booked up. Honestly wasn't sure what to expect but wow, they really took their time with him. The barber (sorry, didn't catch his name but he was the younger guy with the beard) spent like 45 minutes getting the fade just right and even cleaned up his eyebrows without us asking. My son hasn't stopped looking in the mirror since! Place was clean, good music playing, and they actually listened to what he wanted instead of just doing whatever. Will definitely be back.</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">Good spot for a basic haircut. Went in on a Saturday around noon, waited maybe 15 minutes which wasn't bad. The cut was fine, nothing fancy but got the job done. Price was fair - think I paid $25 plus tip. The barber was friendly enough, asked about work and sports while cutting. Only thing is they were pretty busy so felt a little rushed, but for a quick trim it worked out fine. Would go back if I'm in the area.</div>

                        <summary>How much do haircuts cost and do you accept walk-ins?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">Our standard men's haircuts start at $25, with beard trims at $15 and full service cut and beard packages at $35. We do accept walk-ins, but we recommend calling ahead or booking online since we can get busy, especially on weekends and after work hours. Wait times for walk-ins are typically 15-30 minutes during weekdays, but can be longer on Saturdays. Appointments guarantee your preferred time slot.</div>

                        <summary>How long does a typical haircut take and what's included in the service?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">A standard haircut typically takes 30-45 minutes, depending on the complexity of the style and whether you're adding services like a beard trim. Every cut includes a consultation to discuss what you want, the haircut itself, styling, and a neck cleanup with a straight razor. We also include a hot towel finish and light scalp massage. If you're getting a beard trim as well, plan for about an hour total.</div>

                        <div class="faq-answer">Customer satisfaction is our top priority. If you're not happy with your cut, please let us know within 48 hours and we'll make it right at no charge. We'll either adjust the cut to better match what you wanted or have another barber take a look if needed. We've been serving the Rock Hill community for years and our reputation depends on making sure every customer leaves happy. Most issues can be resolved with minor adjustments during your visit, so don't hesitate to speak up if something doesn't look right.</div>
